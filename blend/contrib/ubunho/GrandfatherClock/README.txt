This 3D model was created with Blender 2.57.


Layer 1 contains the Low resolution triangle mesh.
Layer 2 contains the High resolution quad mesh.

The UV unwrapping was rushed, so the textures and normal maps will have to be recomputed and fixed. The high resolution model has the node texture used to generate the wood texture.
