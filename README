   The  DNT  compilation and execution needs some software and 
hardware. They are:

   Software:
      Cal3D     - http://home.gna.org/cal3d/
      OpenAL    - www.openal.org
      OpenGL    
      SDL       - www.libsdl.org
      SDL_image - www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
      SDL_ttf   - www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
      LibVorbis - http://www.vorbis.com/

   
   Hardware:
      Video  Card  with  3D  aceleration, OpenGL  compatible.

==============================================================
|                      II - Instalation                      |
==============================================================

1) Source-Code Distribution

   a) LINUX, BSD, *NIX

   To "install" DNT, decompact the tar.bz2, go to the directory
"dnt",  run   ./configure ,   run   "make"   and,   optionally, 
"make install".

   Example:

   farrer@anamabeka:~/$ tar -xvjf dnt.tar.bz2
   farrer@anamabeka:~/$ cd dnt
   farrer@anamabeka:~/$ autoconf
   farrer@anamabeka:~/dnt/$ ./configure
   farrer@anamabeka:~/dnt/$ make
   farrer@anamabeka:~/dnt/$ sudo make install

   NOTE: the  'make install'  isn't  necessary:  you  can run 
         the game at its local folder.

   NOTE: Any error in the "configure" proccess,  probably  is 
         related with missing development packages for needed
         libraries. Check if you installed them.

   NOTE: If  you  didn't  install  the game, in  order to the 
         language   be   changed,   you'll   need   to  do  a 
         "make install" only  in  the "po" folder. Otherwise,
         the game will be only in english.
 
   b) WINDOWS (We hope you're not using it on Ruindow$).

   To   compile   DNT   on    windows,   you'll   need    the 
Code::Blocks IDE.  Open the project at ./windows folder on it 
and compile.
   Don't blame us. Blame Microsoft!

   c) OSX

   You could  either do the Linux proccess or open the XCode4
project at macos/DccNiTghmare folder and compile there.

   NOTE: Under XCode4 you'll probably need to change paths to
         your installed libraries to be able to compile it.

|                       III - Execution                      |
==============================================================

[*nix note: We'll need to be on X.]

1) Normal Execution (with "make install")

   Just run "dnt" command.  Or, to run the map editor just run 
"dntMapEditor" command.

2) Local Execution (without "make install")

   To   execute  the  program  without  "make install",  go to 
directory ./bin and run the file dnt .

   Those are the defaults. You can  change  the keymap  in the
options.
