\section{Introduction}

Welcome to DccNiTghtmare, a post-nuclear world of adventure and fantasy. In
this game you'll take control of an UFMG student, or from that university you
always dreamed about. In this game you can:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Search for treasures on teacher's room;}
\item{Change that bad score that you can't, by no means, recuperate;}
\item{Kill;}
\item{Plunder;}
\item{Destroy;}
\item{Walk armed in the campus;}
\item{Negotiate tests for biscuits;}
\item{Reach warp 3;}
\item{Recruit hordes to make the chaos with you;}
\item{Fight epic battles;}
\item{"Practice Free-Fight with a carnivorous gorilla" (sic);}
\item{Train battle ameivas to a mortal combat;}
\item{Drink gas when beer is over;}
\end{itemize}

This, among others delightful things that exists in this world. Maybe, after the game, you decide to make a tecnician course instead of the graduation one?

\section{Base Attributes}
DccNiTghtmare follow the D\&D basic attributes. They are:

\subsection{Strength}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/forca.png}
It's the physical strength of the creature, measuring how gross and potential it is. A creature with too much strength can beat like a Titan and smash like a Hulk. A creature with low strength can't beat anyone and is frequently subjugated by others like a little chicken.\\
{\it Ameiva: Strenght 1\\
Ratazana: Strenght 2\\
Ente: Strenght 23\\}

\subsection{Dexterity}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/destreza.png}
It is how skillful, agile, flexible, among others similar adjectives, the creature is. An organism with much dexterity is able to do jugglings with knives and deviate easily from shots. A creature with low dexterity constantly stumbles at its legs and can't set a stone in the wall of a granary.\\
{\it Ameiva: Dexterity 8\\
Ratazana: Dexteterity 12\\
Ente: Dexterity 2}

\subsection{Constitution}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/constituicao.png}
Measures how physical resistent is the organism. A creature with a lot of constitution is so resistent as a horse, able to injected venon on itself to withdrawn the antidote. A character with little constitution is constantly found in vegetative state, and, to him, the common influenza can be lethal.\\
{\it Ameiva: Constitution 12\\
Ratazana: Constitution 6\\
Ente: Constitution 26}

\subsection{Intelligence}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/inteligencia.png}
Measures how smart or dumb the creature is. Organisms with a lot of intelligence can take 80 in OC2 (Computer Organization 2, more than 80 is only for Claudionor Disciples). Creatures too dumb only comunicate by gestures and grunts.\\
{\it Ameiva: Intelligence 6\\
Ratazana: Intelligence 2\\
Ente: Intelligence 16\\}

\subsection{Wisdow}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/sabedoria.png}
Measures how much expert the creature is, knowing how to do in any life situations. An wisdow organism can make 10 years of post graduation without any problem. A creature with low wisdow can be lost in the way from the university restaurant to the bathroom.\\
{\it Ameiva: Wisdow 4\\
Ratazana: Wisdow 6\\
Ente: Wisdow 12}

\subsection{Charism}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/carisma.png}
Measures how eloquent, imponent with words, inspirated or similar adjectives the creature is. A very charismatic organism can aglomerate students groups to invade the University Presidency Building. A not charismatic one can't make his dog obey him.\\
{\it Ameiva: Charism 25\\
Ratazana: Charism 6\\
Ente: Charism 8}

\subsection{Resistances}

\subsubsection{Fortitude}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/fortitude.png}
Is the tested resistence when the creature is in contact with substances or feats that affect or can affect their physical integrity, altering some functions of their body, as poisons, coca-cola or effects of immediate death.

\subsubsection{Reflex}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/reflexos.png}
Is the tested resistence when the creature is against instant effects that require quickly reactions to avoid physical damage.

\subsubsection{I Am Not A Fool}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/vontade.png}
Is the resistence tested when the creature is against mental actions. With more {\it I am not a Foll}, more strong the creature is against compulsions incited by others or protected is its brain, to the point to immunize him of this kind of threat.

\subsection{Others}
DNT also use:

\subsubsection{Armature Class (AC)}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/ca.png}
The Armature Class, or AC, measures how much the creature is external protected (like use of clothes, armors, defensives matrices) when receives some direct strike that affects its physical integrity. More AC means smaller chances of direct strike. The base AC is calculated by {\it 11+Armor+Dexterity Modifier+Varied Bonus}.

\subsubsection{Initiative}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/iniciativa.png}
Measures with how much velocity the creature reacts to threats in the battle begining. Hight bonus means that the chance to the creature make the first attack is greater.

\subsubsection{Life Points (LP)}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/pv.png}
It's the vital resitance of the creature. Highter values, more strikes it can take before collapses. When the Life Points goes to zero, on common cases, the creature is unconscious in the ground. Values lesser than -10 means the creature is dead.

\subsubsection{Displacement}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/deslocamento.png}
It's how much distance can the creature walk on some time interval. Is measured in meters.

\subsubsection{Extern Characters Things}
Are the visual details of the creature, like eye color, hair, size, sex and others.

\subsection{Levels}
Each class level works as 3 months of experience in the selected course class (or profession). The necessary number to evolute is the same as any D\&D like game.

\section{Playable Races}

\subsection{Strange Autistic}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/autista.png}\\
{\it \" -Look at this boy! He is you when you were small!\\
 -No, Farrer, I was a normal and happy child..."\\
(Farrer to a Strange Autistic (Panda), Anamabeka's vocalist, when watching an Oblongs episode where one infant, with eyes of different sizes, sawed his bed utilizing a saw)\\}

Despite of, in the distance, looks like a common and normal person, this
tormented organism suffers serious psychological dysfunctions and
comportamentals detours. These creatures have the power to bring outside their
own world all the elements that exists there, sometimes confunding other races.
Feared by many and misunderstood by everybody, this organism is going to lead
their life as any other race, without put the others, or he, in risk.
Everybody has a little of Strange Autistic inside itself, be this autism a
world of wars and shots, fights and samurais, latin culture or styles of swords
and drums.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Being too much strange for someone else's eyes, the Strange Autistic receives -4 in all {\it social tests} when deal with an aim of opposite tendencies.}
\item{Understanding the fact that everybody is a little Strange Autistic, the Strange Autistic receives a bonus of + 2 in all {\it social tests} when deal with an aim of compatible tendencies.}
\item{The Strange Autistic possess, soon as in the first level, the feats {\it Only you are...} and {\it Confused Actions}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boy / Paty}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/boy.png}\\
{\it "Ah friend, I can't, 'cause I'll do some biceps exercises today"\\
(Tico Bombadinho)\\}

Boys, and their female versions, Patys, are creatures endowed with a strange
fondness to body academies. Always wanting to be slenders to go to jet set
parties and rubbing with their oposite sex equivalents, they usually ignore
their friends of distinct races. But, by more upper they consider theirselves,
and despite they have a huge fondness themselves, this race is always the aim
of mockeries and jokes by other races.\\

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Boys have {\it Driver} as class skill, since they are distinguished offenders of traffic laws.}
\item{Patys have +1 in {\it Diplomacy} since they always exhibit their bodies characteristics. For more horrendous than she was, she is able to "magically" alter herself in few hours.}
\item{By the aforesaid reasons, the Patys also receive + 2 in {\it Disguises}.}
\item{Boys and Patys receive +1 in {\it Constitution} due to the constant time they spend on body academies. If they no more go there, they'll lose this bonus and automatically become aim of jokes among others of their own race.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gothic}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/gotico.png}\\
{\it "I have a problem..."
\\(Creepy Susie)}\\

With their nose facing the moon and their depressive way of life (that for them
are a bale), the Gothic live in groups since cemeteries up to Savassi plaza.
Always dressed entirely in black and with strange makeups, wandering by the
night reciting √Ålvares de Azevedo (Brazilian {\it Lord Byron} clone) and
claiming of their life to the other innocent races. 

They love the internet, but there they forget, from time to time, that they
hate the life, leaving visible flashes of joy and of that everything they do is
only pretend to other's eyes. 

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{\it Sun Weakness}
\item{\it Night Adoration}
\item{\it Laments of One Thousand Souls}
\item{Since Boys/Patys are hightly emotional, Gothics receive +2 in {\it Intimidate} against them.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hippie}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/hippie.png}\\
{\it "They say that they want to save nature, but the only thing they do is smoke maryjane and smells bad!"\\ (Eric Cartman)}\\

Lovers of plants, animals, fungi, worms, air, wind, water, breeze, fire, heat,
in other words, everything that emanate something from nature and can transmit
them energy or karma (no, we aren't talking about Druid Elfs), the hippies can
be for hours listening to the wind voice or seeing little land worms entering
their bodies, since equiped with high LSD doses.\\

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Since they have a lot of love for the nature, the el.., I've said, hippies, receive +5 in {\it Train Animals}.}
\item{Usually Hippies creatures aren't well accept by society, fearful of their subversives actions based on LSD, so, they receive -6 in {\it Free-pass}.}
\item{Hippies receive, in their first level, the feat {\it Lago Seco do Diabo (LSD)}.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Human}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/humano.png}\\
{\it "Satana sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto"\\
 (Demon talking to Ivan Karamazov)}\\

Also knowleged as {\it Homo Sapiens Sapiens}. An human is an human, uai! Look
the rest at your D\&D book cause I'm too busy to write normal things here. We
really hope that nobody owns the patent of the name "human" and we have to use
another denomination to this race in reason of copyright violations.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{The Common Human is so normal and so common that don't own any extraordinary quality nor extraordinary defect.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Human Llama}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/llama.png}\\
{\it "Is he insane??"\\
("Oktober Fest"'s Queen, while looking at Farrer, the llama)}\\

Human llamas are humans that believe earnestly they are nearly descendants of
the Andes llamas. Usually they walk with a bolivian poncho, drink a lot of
water and think exactly like a llama.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{\it Need Water}
\item{Human llamas receive +2 in {\it Intelligence}.}
\item{For having sociopats tendencies, the Human Llammas receive -4 in all {\it social tests}.}
\item{{\it I dislike you}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Headbanger}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/metaleiro.png}\\
{\it "Dark... "\\
(Anamatheus Iskurium)\\}

These creatures usually walk with black pants, black skirts (of bands or not)
and military boots. They wear this kind of clothes to "be different", althought
all of them use the same. They love to play all things they find thinking it
was a drum, and to sing the lyrics of the musics they love. Usually passed as
autistcs, these creatures walk with others headbangers (from 2 to 5) and have
the need to show others their "revolt". They are attracted easily by anything
that looks "malignant", for more rougher than it can be.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{{\it Voluntary Autistim}}
\item{{\it Prompt Mosh}}
\item{Since Boys/Patys are hightly emotional, Headbangers receive +2 in {\it Intimidate} against them.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Skinhead Maniac}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/skin.png}\\
{\it \" - Is 'cause ther'are some peopl'in front of my house that puts a pagode in high volume on the weekends...\\
 - There is, so? Give me R\$500,00 and I'll five you a fragmentation granade to throw up there and end with their party!"\\
(Corrente, Skinhead Maniac, answering Gordo, Mechanical engineering frustrated studant)}\\

Skinhead Maniacs are a rare race in the campus. Without any comon sense, these
creatures don't lose time to finalize their objectives in the more directly
possible way. Walking alone in the world, they aren't capable to make friends
with any other race, always wanting to end those they dislike.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Skinhead Maniacs, since they have army's friends, can get any kind of heavy guns and walk freely with them. So, they receive the skill {\it Free-pass} for class skill for any choosed class.}
\item{{\it Insane Fury}}
\item{Since they don't have common sense, Skinhead Maniacs have to be of Alignment / Tendency {\it Capitalist Proprietary-Software} or {\it Chaotic Proprietary-Software}.}
\item{{\it Call Hordes}}
\item{Since they are solitary creatures, they can't walk in groups. Their unic reforce is the Hordes that goes away after the battle.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mutant Human Cricket}
\includegraphics{../data/races/Img/grilo.png}\\
{\it "A tasty Cricket, please!"\\
(Logan in a barbecue restaurant)}\\

No one knows why, but mutant things started to habit Icex. With their diet
based on crickets or small hopping bugs, the Human Cricket have some
canibalistic habits and, for this, are not welcome by bugs. The habitat of the
Human Cricket is the famous Tyrol, near Barreiro, where they live happily
among their parents.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Since they eat Crickets, Human Crickts receive -4 in all {\it social tests} when threat with someone of their race or insects.}
\item{By obvious reasons, the Human Cricket receives +6 in {\it Jump}.}
\end{itemize}


\section{Alignment / Tendency}

The alignments and the tendencies in DccNiTghtmare are composed by the following possibilities\\

\subsection{Libertarian Free-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/libertarian.png} Libertarian Free-Software Adepts usually are creatures that believe in the free circulation of knowledge, without any intervention, be of governments, be of private groups or individuals. Usually they are adepts of public domain software.

\subsection{Center Free-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/gnu.png} Center Free-Software Adepts also believes in the free knowledge circulation, but, for them, the circulation hasn't to be as free as in public domain, but restrict to be free for all since continue free. Usually they are only adepts of GPL licences.

\subsection{Chaotic Free-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/beastie.png} Chaotic Free-Software are more permissive to the software license, since they are without charge and let full access to the source code.

\subsection{Functional Neutral} \includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/canivete.png} Functional Neutral creatures don't have a solid position on software licenses. They are adepts of software that works correctly (and this concept is a lot vague).

\subsection{Center Neutral} \includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/muro.png} The thing more on top of the wall in the DccNiTghtmare's universe.  They have tendency to be favorable to what people near them are.

\subsection{Chaotic Neutral} \includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/yang.png} Chaotic Neutral creatures sometimes are free software adepts, sometimes are proprietary software adepts, depending on their daily humor.

\subsection{Capitalist Proprietary-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/ruindows.png} Capitalist Proprietary-Software Adepts have in uncle Bill Portoe\$ their big idol. They want to be rich with the software they make, although, most of them, have their work explored by national software factories.

\subsection{Neutral Proprietary-Software Adept} \includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/cifrao.png} Neutral Proprietary-Sorftware Adepts want to make money with their programs, but distrust of the absence of security on their Ruindow\$.

\subsection{Chaotic Proprietary-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/niquel.png} The wealth sometimes interest them, sometimes not, also uncle Port√µe\$, although they consider the Free-Software Adepts as crazy guys.

\section{Classes}

\subsection{Administration Student}
\includegraphics{../data/classes/Img/administracao.png}
{\it "Steel with steel is bad..."\\(Zamboy, future Administration Student)}\\

Also knowledged as Taylor's  little boys, Administration Students are frequently found in self-help shelves of commercial bookstores. They enter in this course  since they not really know what want to their lifes (exacts science, human science, group  dynamics??) and, although in most of the cases don't possess NOTHING to administer, they think, vehemently, that are doing the helpful and certain thing to their lives.\\

\item{+2 {\it Constitution}: The Taylor's Knowledges are a common part of the Administration Students, so their {\it Taylor's Bovinice} is always inerent.}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Since they are Taylor's fiel disciples, they receive +4 in {\it Taylor's Bovinice Skill}, also +4 em {\it Bizarre Clothes}, because in their dogmatic cult to Taylor they found bizarre things (and with maximun financial efficiency) to be their "clothes".}
\item{Everyone knows that the Administration Students have a lot of difficulty in assimilate other's opinions, and also to ask in a concise way some question, so they receive -6 in {\it Listen}.}

{\it 
\"-I really don't know why I'm making this graduation...\\
- How not?? For the womans, obvious!"\\
(Gushm, Computer Science Student, answering the CS dilema)}\\

Computes Science Student is the most bizarre class in DccNiTghtmare (and,
paradoxically, the most common). They are know by their suicidal choices (the
first one is the graduation they choosed), their little patience to view what
their masters denominate "classes", the infinity time spent in Pratical
Exercises (TP) and the hate when they percept that it works perfectly, but their
masters won't look and appraise it, since CS teachers are displicents and
without any compromise with the graduation.\\

{\bf Live Dice:} {\it d8}

After enter the faculty in the hope of learn everything about cars, planes, boats and other mechanical structures of high complexity, they uncover that the world is summarized to {\it F = m*a}. In the possession of that simple equation and of absurd quantities of inexplicable calculations, the teachers of physics make their life a hell in the basic course.
