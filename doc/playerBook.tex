\section{Base Attributes}
DccNiTghtmare follow the D\&D basic attributes. They are:

\subsection{Strength}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/forca.png}
It's the physical strength of the creature, measuring how gross and potential it is. A creature with too much strength can beat like a Titan and smash like a Hulk. A creature with low strength can't beat anyone and is frequently subjugated by others by be a little chicken.\\
{\it Ameiva: Strenght 1\\
Ratazana: Força 2\\
Ente: Força 23\\}

\subsection{Dexterity}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/destreza.png}
It is how skillful, agile, flexible, among others similar adjectives, the creature is. An organism with much dexterity is able to do jugglings with knives and deviate easily from shots. A creature with low dexterity constantly stumbles at its legs and can't set a stone in the wall of a granary.\\
{\it Ameiva: Dexterity 8\\
Ratazana: Dexteterity 12\\
Ente: Dexterity 2}

\subsection{Constitution}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/constituicao.png}
Measures how physical resistent is the organism. A creature with a lot of constitution is as resistent as a horse, can injecting venon on itself to after withdrawn the antidote. A character with little constitution is constantly found in vegetative state, the common influenza being able to be lethal.\\
{\it Ameiva: Constitution 12\\
Ratazana: Constitution 6\\
Ente: Constitution 26}

\subsection{Inteligency}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/inteligencia.png}
Measures how much smart or dumb the creature is. Organisms with a lot of inteligency can take 80 in OC2 (Computer Organization 2, more than 80 is only for Claudionor Disciples). Creatures too much dumb only can comunicate by gestures and grunts.\\
{\it Ameiva: Inteligency 2\\
Ratazana: Inteligency 2\\
Ente: Inteligency 16\\}

\subsection{Wisdow}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/sabedoria.png}
É quão esperto o organismo é, sabendo se virar nas mais diversas situações da vida. Um organismo muito sábio é capaz de cursar 10 anos de faculdade sem nenhum problema. Um organismo pouco sábio é capaz de se perder no caminho entre a cantina e o banheiro.\\
{\it Ameiva: Sabedoria 4\\
Ratazana: Sabedoria 6\\
Ente: Sabedoria 12}

\subsection{Charism}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/carisma.png}
É quão eloquente, imponente com as palavras, inspirador ou adjetivos semelhantes, o organismo é. Um organismo muito carismático é capaz de reunir grandes grupos de Estudantes para invadirem a reitoria. Um personagem pouco carismático não consegue nem fazer seu cachorro obedecê-lo.\\
{\it Ameiva: Carisma 25\\
Ratazana: Carisma 6\\
Ente: Carisma 8}

\subsection{Resistances}

\subsubsection{Fortitude}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/fortitude.png}
É a resistência testada dos organismos quando estes lidam com substâncias ou habilidades que afetem ou possam afetar a sua integridade física, alterando alguma função de seu corpo, como venenos, coca-cola ou efeitos de morte instantânea.

\subsubsection{Reflex}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/reflexos.png}
É a resistência testada dos organismos quando estes lidam contra efeitos praticamente instantâneos que exijam de seus reflexos rápidos para que se possa evitar dano físico.

\subsubsection{I Am Not A Fool}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/vontade.png}
É a resistência testada dos organismos quando estes estão lidando contra ações mentais dirigidas a ele. Quanto mais {\it Não Sou Bobo} tiver o organismo, mais forte ele é contra compulsões incitadas por outros ou mais entorpecido é seu cérebro, a ponto de imunizá-lo deste tipo de ameaça.

\subsection{Others}
Utiliza-se também:

\subsubsection{Armature Class (AC)}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/ca.png}
A classe de armadura, ou CA dos personagens, é quão protegido externamente(como uso de roupas grossas, armaduras, matrizes defensivas...) o personagem está quando este recebe algum golpe direto que afete a sua integridade física. Quanto mais alta for sua CA, menores são as chances de o personagem ser acertado diretamente. A CA base de um personagem é 11+Armadura+Modificador de Destreza Aplicado+Bônus Variado.

\subsubsection{Initiative}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/iniciativa.png}
É o quão rápido o organismo reage ao perigo, agindo antes dos demais no início de um combate. Altos bônus significam que o organismo tem mais chances de atacar primeiro.

\subsubsection{Life Points (LP)}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/pv.png}
É a resistência vital possuida por um organismo. Quanto mais elevados, mais golpes este tem de levar fisicamente para cair em colapso. Quando os Pontos de Vida(PVs) chegam a zero, em casos comuns o organismo cai inconsciente no chão. Ao chegarem a -10 o organismo morre.

\subsubsection{Displacement}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/deslocamento.png}
É quão longe o organismo consegue chegar durante um determinado intervalo de tempo. O deslocamento é medido em metros, indicando quantos metros o organismo pode percorrer.

\subsubsection{Extern Characters Things}
 São os detalhes visuais do organismo: cor do olho, cabelo, tamanho, dentre outros.

\subsection{Levels}
Cada nível de classe funciona como 3 meses de árdua experiência passados no curso (ou na profissão). O número de pontos necessários para "evoluir" é o mesmo que os de D\&D.

\section{Playable Races}

world of wars and shots, fights and samurais, latin culture or styles of swords
and drums.

{\it "Ah friend, I can't, 'cause I'll do some biceps exercises today"\\
(Tico Bombadinho)\\}

Boys, and their female versions, Patys, are creatures endowed with a strange fondness to body academies. Always wanting to be slenders to go to jet set parties and rubbing with their oposite sex equivalents, they usually ignore their friends of distinct races. But, by more upper they consider theirselves, and despite they have a huge fondness themselves, this race is always the aim of mockeries and jokes by other races.\\
