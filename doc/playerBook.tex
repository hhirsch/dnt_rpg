\section{Introduction}

Welcome to DccNiTghtmare, a post-nuclear world of adventure and fantasy. In this
game you'll take control of an UFMG student, or from that university you always
dreamed about, and make unimaginable vicissitudes in your graduation. In this
game you can:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Search for treasures on teacher's room;}
\item{Change that bad score that you can't, by no means, recoup;}
\item{Kill;}
\item{Plunder;}
\item{Destroy;}
\item{Walk armed in the campus;}
\item{Negotiate tests for biscuits;}
\item{Reach warp 3;}
\item{Recruit a bunch to make the chaos with you;}
\item{Make epic battles;}
\item{"Practise Free-Fight with a carnivorous gorilla" (sic);}
\item{Train battle ameivas to a mortal combat;}
\item{Drink gas when beer is over;}
\end{itemize}

This, among others delightful things that exists in this world. Maybe, after the game, you decide to make a tecnician course instead the graduation one?

\section{Base Attributes}
DccNiTghtmare follow the D\&D basic attributes. They are:

\subsection{Strength}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/forca.png}
It's the physical strength of the creature, measuring how gross and potential it is. A creature with too much strength can beat like a Titan and smash like a Hulk. A creature with low strength can't beat anyone and is frequently subjugated by others to be a little chicken.\\
{\it Ameiva: Strenght 1\\
Ratazana: Força 2\\
Ente: Força 23\\}

\subsection{Dexterity}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/destreza.png}
It is how skillful, agile, flexible, among others similar adjectives, the creature is. An organism with much dexterity is able to do jugglings with knives and deviate easily from shots. A creature with low dexterity constantly stumbles at its legs and can't set a stone in the wall of a granary.\\
{\it Ameiva: Dexterity 8\\
Ratazana: Dexteterity 12\\
Ente: Dexterity 2}

\subsection{Constitution}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/constituicao.png}
Measures how physical resistent is the organism. A creature with a lot of constitution is as resistent as a horse, can injecting venon on itself to after withdrawn the antidote. A character with little constitution is constantly found in vegetative state, the common influenza being able to be lethal.\\
{\it Ameiva: Constitution 12\\
Ratazana: Constitution 6\\
Ente: Constitution 26}

\subsection{Intelligence}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/inteligencia.png}
Measures how much smart or dumb the creature is. Organisms with a lot of intelligence can take 80 in OC2 (Computer Organization 2, more than 80 is only for Claudionor Disciples). Creatures too much dumb only can comunicate by gestures and grunts.\\
{\it Ameiva: Intelligence 2\\
Ratazana: Intelligence 2\\
Ente: Intelligence 16\\}

\subsection{Wisdow}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/sabedoria.png}
Measures how much expert the creature is, knowing how to do in any life situations. An wisdow organism can make 10 years of pos graduation without any problem. A creature with low wisdow can be lost in the way between the university restaurant and the bathroom.\\
{\it Ameiva: Wisdow 4\\
Ratazana: Wisdow 6\\
Ente: Wisdow 12}

\subsection{Charism}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/carisma.png}
Measures how eloquent, imponent with words, inspiration or similar adjectives the creature is. A very charismatic organism can aglomerate students groups to invade the Unversity Presidency Building. A not charismatic one can't make his dog obey him.\\
{\it Ameiva: Charism 25\\
Ratazana: Charism 6\\
Ente: Charism 8}

\subsection{Resistances}

\subsubsection{Fortitude}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/fortitude.png}
Is the tested creature resistence when they are in contact with substances or feats that affect or can affect their physical integrity, altering some function of their body, as poisons, coca-cola or effects of instant death.

\subsubsection{Reflex}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/reflexos.png}
Is the tested creature resistence when they handle against practically instant effects that require quickly reacts to avoid physical damage.  

\subsubsection{I Am Not A Fool}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/vontade.png}
Is the creature resistence tested when they handle against mental actions. With more {\it I am not a Foll}, more strong the creature is against compulsions incited by others or protected is its brain, to the point of immunize-him of this kind of threat.

\subsection{Others}
Also use:

\subsubsection{Armature Class (AC)}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/ca.png}
The Armature Class, or AC, measures how much is the creature external protected (like use of coarse clothes, armors, defensives matrices) when receives some direct strike that affects its physical integrity. More AC means smaller chances of direct strike. The base AC is calculated by {\it 11+Armor+Dexterity Modifier+Varied Bonus}.

\subsubsection{Initiative}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/iniciativa.png}
Measures with how much velocity the creature reacts to threats in the battle begining. Hight bonus means that the chance to the creature makes the first attack is greater.

\subsubsection{Life Points (LP)}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/pv.png}
Is the vital resitance of the creature. Highter values, more strikes it can take before collapses. When the Life Points goes to zero, on common cases, the creature is unconscious in the ground. Values lesser than -10 means the creature is dead.

\subsubsection{Displacement}
\includegraphics{../data/skills/Img/deslocamento.png}
Is how much distance can the creature walk in some time interval. It is measures in meters.

\subsubsection{Extern Characters Things}
Are the visual details of the creature, like eye color, hair, size, and others.

Despite of, in the distance, looks like a common and normal person, this
tormented organism suffers serious psychological dysfunctions and
comportamentals detours. These creatures have the power to bring outside their
own world all the elements that exists there, sometimes confunding other races.
Feared by many and misunderstood by everybody, this organism is going to lead
their life as any another one race, without put the others, or he, in risk.
Everybody has a little of Strange Autistic inside itself, be this autism a
world of wars and shots, fights and samurais, latin culture or styles of swords
and drums.

{\it "Ah friend, I can't, 'cause I'll do some biceps exercises today"\\
(Tico Bombadinho)\\}

Boys, and their female versions, Patys, are creatures endowed with a strange fondness to body academies. Always wanting to be slenders to go to jet set parties and rubbing with their oposite sex equivalents, they usually ignore their friends of distinct races. But, by more upper they consider theirselves, and despite they have a huge fondness themselves, this race is always the aim of mockeries and jokes by other races.\\

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
- Boys have {\it Driver} as class skill, since they are distinguished offenders of traffic laws.\\

\\(Creepy Susie)}\\

With their nose facing the moon and their depressive way of life, that for them are a bale, the Gothic live in flocks since cemeteries up to Savassi plaza.  Always dressed entirely in black and with strange makeups, wander by the night reciting Álvares de Azevedo (Brazilian Lord Byron clone) and claiming of the life for the other innocent races. They love the internet, but there they forgot, from time to time, that hates the life, leaving visible flashes of joy and of that everything they do is only to pretend to other's eyes.

\subsection{Common Human}
{\it "Satana sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto"\\
 (Demon talking to Dimitri Karamazov)}\\

Also knowleged as {\it Homo Sapiens Sapiens}. An human is an human, uai! Look the rest at your D\&D book cause I'm too busy to write normal things here. We really hope that nobody owns the patent to the name "human" and we have to use another to this race in reason of copyright violations.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
- The Common Human is so normal and so common that don't own any extraordinary quality nor extraordinary defects.

\subsection{Human Llama}

They love to play all things they find thinking it was a drum, and to sing the lyrics of the musics they love. Usually passed as autistcs, these creatures walk with others headbangers (from 2 to 5) and have the need to show others their "revolt". They are attracted easily by any thing that looks "malignant", for more rougher than it can be.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
-{\it Voluntary Autistim}\\
-{\it Prompt Mosh}\\
- Since Boys/Patys are hightly emotional, Headbangers receive +2 in {\it intimidation} against them.

\subsection{Skinhead Maniac}

 - There is, so? Give me R\$500,00 and I'll five you a fragmentation granade for you throw up there and end with their party!"\\
(Corrente, Skinhead Maniac, to Gordo, Mechanical engineering frustrated studant)}\\

Skinhead Maniacs are a rare race in the campus. Without any comon sense, these creatures don't lose time to finalize their objectives in the more directly possible way. Walking alone in the world, they aren't capable to make friends with any other race, always wanting to end the races they dislike.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
- Skinhead Maniacs, since they have army's friends, can get any kind of heavy guns and walk freely with them. So, they receive the skill {\it Free-pass} for class skill for any choosed class;\\

No one knows why, but mutant things starte to habit the Icex. With their diet based on crickets or small hopping bugs, the Human Cricket have some canibalistic habits and, for this, are not welcome by bugs. The habitat of the Human Cricket s the famous Tyrol, next to Barreiro, where they live happily among their parents.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
- Since they eat Crickets, Human Crickts receive -4 in all {\it social tests} when threat with someone of their race or insects.\\
- By obvious reasons, the Human Cricket receives + 6 in {\it Jump};\\


\section{Alignment / Tendency}

The alignments and the tendencies in DccNiTghtmare are composed by the following possibilities\\
\subsection{Libertarian Free-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/libertarian.png} Libertarian Free-Software Adepts usually are creatures are creatures that believe in the free circulation of knowledge, without any intervention, be of governments, be of private groups or individuals. Usually they are adepts of public domain software.
\subsection{Center Free-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/gnu.png} Center Free-Software Adepts also believes in the free knowledge circulation, but, for them, the circulation hasn't to be as free as in public domain, but restrict to be free for all since continue free. Usually they are only adepts of GPL licences.
\subsection{Chaotic Free-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/beastie.png} Chaotic Free-Software are more permissive to the software license, since they are without charge and let full access to the source code.
\subsection{Functional Neutral} \includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/canivete.png} Functional Neutral creatures don't have a solid position on software licenses. They are adepts of software that works correctly (and this concept is a lot vague).
\subsection{Center Neutral} \includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/muro.png} The thing more on top of the wall in the DccNiTghtmare's universe.  They have tendency to be favorable to what people near them are.
\subsection{Chaotic Neutral} \includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/yang.png} Chaotic Neutral creature sometimes are free software adepts, sometimes are proprietary software adepts, depending on their daily humor.
\subsection{Capitalist Proprietary-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/ruindows.png} Capitalist Proprietary-Software Adepts have in uncle Bill Portoe\$ their big idol. They want to be richs with the software they make, although, most of them, have their work explored by national software factories.
\subsection{Neutral Proprietary-Software Adept} \includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/cifrao.png} Neutral Proprietary-Sorftware Adepts want to make money with their programs, but distrust of the absence of security on their Ruindow\$.
\subsection{Chaotic Proprietary-Software Adept}\includegraphics{../data/alignment/Img/niquel.png} The wealth sometimes interest them, sometimes not, also uncle Portõe\$, although they consider the Free-Software Adepts as crazy guys.

\section{Classes}

\subsection{Administration Student}
{\it "Steel with Steel don't combine..."\\(Zamboy, future Administration Student)}\\

Also know as Taylor's boys, the Administration Students are easily found in the auto-aid sheves of bookstores and libraries. They made this career because they don't know really what they want to their lifes (Exacts Sciences, Human Sciences, Group Dynamics??) and, even so usually they don't have anything to administrate, they vehemently think that they are making the correctly thing (and choices) to their lives.\\ 

{\bf Life Dice:} {\it d4}

\subsubsection{Attributes}
-2 {\it Intelligence}: Administration Students, definitively,  aren't know by their intelectual {\it (Am I wrong Elis Regina???)}.\\

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
Since they are Taylor's fiel disciples, they receive +4 in {\it Taylor's Bovinice Skill}, also +4 em {\it Bizarre Clothes}, because in their dogmatic cult to Taylor they found bizarre things (and with maximun financial efficiency) to be their "clothes". \\

Able to be for two weeks isoleted in the mountains making their "Field Works", ambushing and observing the incredible and exciting ameiva's feed habits (and, for it, sometimes mistaken as {\it Hippies} in their search for Feed-Karma), the Biology Students are from all things a little: a little medicians, a little hippies, a little computers, a little hot-dog sellers...\\

{\bf Live Dice:} {\it d8}

\subsubsection{Attributes}
+2 in {\it Dexterity}, since they always observe and follow in distinct terrains the ameivas (and also to open its body, counting how many worms it has)\\

\subsection{Computer Science Student}
{\it 
\"-I really don't know why i making this degree...\\
- How not?? For the womans, obvious!"\\
(Gushm, Computer Science Student, asking the CS dilema)}\\

Computes Science Student is the most bizarre class in DccNiTghtmare (and, paradoxically, the most common). They are know by their suicidal choices (the first one is the graduation they choosed), their little patience to view what their masters denominate "classes", the infinity time spent in Pratical Exercises (TP) and the hate when they percept that it work perfectly, but their masters won't look and appraise it, since CS teachers are displicents and without any compromise with the graduation.\\

{\bf Live Dice:} {\it d8}

\subsubsection{Attributes}
+2 {\it Wisdow}: since all they are auto-teachers, because they can't count with theirs teachers.\\
-1 {\it Charism}: by their natural tendency to be qualified as Nerd, being one or not.

\subsection{Law Student}
{\it \" - Are we going to the bar taking one?\\
        - Yes, from who?"\\(Typical dialog between two law students)}\\

Living at the Campus disguised as penguins, the Law Students are organisms that, when perceive the minor possibility to make profits by some situation they judge "juridic", will use of all their verborragy, deturpations and sofisms to make it. Is always important to have a Law Student in your group (party), be for avoid other Law Students knowledge (and policial aparate) to take vantages on you, or be for take vantages form others and avoid that iminent punition.\\
