Name: Sarah
Female, 31 years.

Profile: fearful, paranoid but dangerous in critical situations. Usually shy,
extremely aggressive in critical situations.

Story: After the bomb, she was with her husband and her 13 years old son a
bunker for months until the food ran out. Finally, the food ran out and she
slaughtered her husband to nourish both her child and herself. She made up a
story about the husband leaving to check if it is possible to live on the
surface.

Her son left her when she was sleeping. It is not clear whether he realized
what must have happened and left in disgust or whether he went to look for his
father.

Soon, she too would leave. Fearing death but not wanting to stay alone. It
turned out life on the surface is not problematic but she remains paranoid.

Picture could illustrate her fear while at the same time showing
aggression/danger. For example: fearful eyes but threatening mouth/teeth (might
be a bad suggestion). Hair should be red/brown/black, possibly with grey hairs
in it from stress.
