Character idea: A sexist character, which will annoy you by insulting your
gender with gender-specific stereotypes, no matter what gender your player
character is. That character might be actually be using alignment too. Not
sure what the purpose would be. It could be a test of self-control, it could
be a tool for trying to trigger the player's emotions in a negative way to
brainwash them into remembering DNT and making DNT players have a common
target of hate. On the other hand it might be amusing to players how bad we
are at trying to provoke them.

A cyborg, robot or computer AI could be other options.
