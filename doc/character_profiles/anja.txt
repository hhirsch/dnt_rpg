Name: Anja

Anja was a game designer, who at the start of her career went through
male-to-female SRS, which became a central theme in her work.

Now that there is not much time for game consumption for most of the
population, she uses her attention to detail to tweak, repair and enhance
weapons.

She was license-agnostic as a game designer and she is license-agnostic now.

Note: This character is inspired by Anna Anthropy.
