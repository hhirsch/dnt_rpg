Name: Magda

   Magda was one of the rare friendly kind of lunchroom staff before the bomb.
She more or less was able to keep her job after she found the key to the supply
room and is now serving food to survivors who are willing to trade for it.

   Considering the circumstances, she is in great shape. She lost 80 pounds (36
kg) after the disaster. Actually, she also lost an eye, parts of her ear and
many of her teeth but nonetheless she kept her friendly smile and a “now it
definitely can’t get any worse” optimistic attitude
