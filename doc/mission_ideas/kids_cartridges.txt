(non-hidden) quest related to the cartridge collecting.

  - It starts as soon as you accept any of the kids' offers.
  
  - The quest should be called "Game Cartridge Delivery", description:
    "There is at least one kid in Tyrol interested in acquiring SNES game
     cartridges from you. Bring them all the cartridges that you can find!"
     
  - It succeeds and gives you some XP as soon as every cartridge is in
    the inventory of one of the 3 kids. (Perhaps only alive kids
    should be counted?)
  
  - It fails if all kids are dead and the quest has not yet been completed.
    (If you permanently rejected the alive kid's offers, they should also be
    counted as "dead" for the sake of calculating the failure?
    
  - If you kill (all) the kids or take away/buy away cartridges, the quest
    should stay unchanged. It's basically a one-time reward for finding and
    selling all game cartridges.
