The fighting mode is, in somethings, distict than the normal mode of the game. Here your movimentation is limited and the action is taked in turns.

The game goes to fight mode each time when there are enemies in renge area (and they want to attack your character) or you want to attack any NPC in the area.

\subsubsection{Initing a Fight}

When you want to init by yourself the fight mode, you can use the button of fight in the ShortCuts Window. By done it, you enter in the fight mode, in your active character's turn (called surprise attack turn) where functions like any other normal turn. If at the end of this turn you've not attacked, the game exits the attack mode. Otherwise, continue the fight in the  correspondent initiative values orderf.

\subsubsection{Player Character's Turn}

\begin{center}

When is player character's turn, like D\&D, the character can take a standart action and a move action, in any order, two move actions or a full round action. The area that the character can walk with one move action is represented in the blue circle; the two move actions is represented in the red circle.

The player choose the actions to be made on the turn, doing all of them and, when done with it, end the turn.

\subsubsection{End Turn}

When you done all things that you want (and that you can) in your turn, you can pass the fight to next character's turn. You can do it by clicking in the ShortCuts Window button of End Turn.
