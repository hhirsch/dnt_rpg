# This script is a test to the DNT script language
# actually, it don't do anything util.
#
# things that the language don't support:
#   - if without a end or a else
#   - else without end
#   - while without end
#   - statments before the main
#   - expressions as functions parameters (they must be assign to variables
#                                          before used as parameters)
#   - literals as functions parameters
#   - declare functions (will add it latter);
#   - comments after some statments (the comments must be full lines)
#   - direct assign at declaration (like int a = 20)
#
# details (supported):
#   - multiple variables declarations
#   - expressions
#   - functions as functions parameters
#   - else if

# All scripts need to have a script()
# that will mark its beginning, like
# a C main() function.
script()

   #its a multiple variable declaration. Each variable
   #is separated with spaces.

   #ifs tests
   if( (c > 40) && (a > 10) && (!variavel) )
      int t
      if(c < 40)
         int t1
      else
         int f1
      end
   else

   #while tests
   int count
