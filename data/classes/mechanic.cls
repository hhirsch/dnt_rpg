gettext("The student  of mechanical engineering is|the campus most frustrated person.  After|enter   the  faculty in the hope of learn|everything about cars, planes,  boats and|other   mechanical   structures  of  high|complexity,  they  uncover that the world|is   summarized   to   F = m*a.  In   the|possession of that simple equation and of|absurd    quantities   of    inexplicable|calculations,  the  teachers  of  physics|make  their  life  a  hell  in  the basic|course.  In  the  specific  classes  they|realize  that  the world was happy in the|basic cycle.  Generally  they're seen  in|all classes  inside the Exacts Institute,|therefore  no  one  of is going to finish|the course regularly.")

The  total|absence  of  contact  with  that  kind of|agency causes a  barely unruly  frenzy in|the  student,  that  should  do a test of|I Am Not A Fool (with the penalty of -10)|to not jump wildily on top of the female.|In the  case  of fail, the student enters|in  frenzy  and  will  try  with  all his|forces to 'copulate' with the same one.")
